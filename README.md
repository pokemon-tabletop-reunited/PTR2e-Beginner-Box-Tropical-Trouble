# PTR2e Beginner Box - Tropical Trouble
A Starter Adventure to help get the hang of using Pokemon Tabletop Reunited: Evolved to run Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Scenarios.

## Installing the Module
You can install the module using Foundry's Module Installation window (not World!) using the following Manifest URL:
```
https://github.com/pokemon-tabletop-reunited/PTR2e-Beginner-Box-Tropical-Trouble/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

After having installed the module, you can open up any world (we recommend a clean one!), and enable the module.

After doing so, you will find the 'Adventure' located in the Compendium Tab in Foundry
